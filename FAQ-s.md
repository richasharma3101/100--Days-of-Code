# Frequently Asked Questions
I am sharing the answer to not asked questions but these questions comes to mind very frequently.

### Qs 1: What is the purpose of this challenge?
### Ans 1: The sole purpose of this challenge is to remove the fear of coding from everyone.

### Qs 2: Is there any fixed set of problems to work on?
### Ans 2: No, there is no fixed set of problems. One can code anything as per her need and will. No, there is no limit of set amount of problems to be solved daily. You just need to code for an hour daily and then need to update that here in [Logs](https://github.com/chetanhere/100-days-of-code/blob/master/log.md) file. And also announce that publicly.

### Qs 3: I am not efficient in coding, do I need to start solving problems from the day 0?
### Ans 3: This challenge is designed for the non coders, so you can start with Hello World program and that would also be counted as valid submission. Then you can move to other small programs (like adding two numbers and all simple stuff).

### Qs 4: Can I opt some other language other than Python and JavaScript?
### Ans 4: Yes, you can always opt. You can even do basic HTML & CSS. That would also be a valid submission.

### Qs 5: Why there is a code repository and day-wise problems there like c0.txt and all?
### Ans 5: That code repository is just to guide, how to make code repository for your code. Specific set of problems are just to guide you to start with. In case you are short of ideas and want to refer from some source then you can follow that c0.txt and c1.txt and so .... on plan. Otherwise, you are completely free to follow your own path.
